 * @file barrier.cc
 * @brief Basic Synchronization Patterns - Barrier
 *
 * Barrier â€“ Race Start Synchronization
 * Problem: In an Olympic race, all runners must be at the starting line
 * and wait for the gunshot before starting the race.
 *
 * Synchronization Solution:
 *
 * A barrier ensures that no runner starts before all are ready.
 * The race gun (triggered by the referee) is released only after all runners
 * reach the starting line.
 *
 * Turnstile:
 * Threads increment a counter as they arrive.
 * When all threads arrive, a turnstile semaphore opens.
 * Each thread must pass through the turnstile one at a time.
